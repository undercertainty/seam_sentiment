       "4  Very much enjoyed the module, and what I have learned has already come in very handy at work. While it doesnt turn me into a database admin or designer all of a sudden, it allows me to interact with the relevant IT people at my job in a more effective manner due to my greater understanding of the correct terms and procedures, and how it all works. It has given me a greater appreciation of what can or cannot be achieved.The workload was fitting for the 30 credit points, and the icmas gave lots of opportunity to practise and check my knowledge as I went on. All in all a very valuable module, definitely worth the time and money spent.   \n",

Some students seemed to experience issues getting the module software (sensibly packaged as a virtual machine) running, but the forums were good for assistance here, and I had no issues.Lots of interesting data analysis techniques to learn, but none appeared truly essential to passing. This allowed me to focus on the context for such tools, and the overarching reasons for the analyses.   \n",

I found that while there was a lot to do it was obvious that many improvements had been made and streamlining opportunities had been taken. This meant that the fears I had going into this module did not come to pass. I definitely enjoyed the module. One major drawback however was that in order to run the software I had to purchase a new laptop. With the increasing fees this was a commitment that I could ill afford.  \n",

       "54       0             I was disappointed a bit by the fact that the EMA of the module was just one thing, a data investigation, personally I am not particularly interested in this area of work/study and more took this module to expand my knowledge on Databases.It is slightly worrying that my final degree mark will be affected by the fact that I was only assessed in the EMA on something I wasnt especially interested in or skilled at.For this module to be included in a Comluting and IT degree there should be more focus on elements of DBs as used in Software Systems rather than just for data investigationsI did enjoy learning about some of the bits though such as data mining and NoSql DBs   \n",
